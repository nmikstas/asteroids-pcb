# asteroids-pcb
PCB source for the original Asteroids arcade game. This is a reproduction of a rev. 2 PCB. There are two sets of gerber files: the main Asteroids PCB and a small adapter board for IC 8C. 8C was a masked ROM that is no longer available. The adapter PCB will allow a 2716 EPROM to be used in it's place. A 28C16A-25 flash ROM will also work.
